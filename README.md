Im 26 years old and live in Morgantown, West Virginia. I built my first computer at age 10 from two broken computers the neighbor's 
left outside on the curb for garbage pick-up. I swapped out broken hardware in one for good hardware out of the other one. 
I have always loved technology and im a Certified Manual Machinist. I wanted to learn to program CNC machines at first. However I 
decided against it for the lack of practical for anything other than machining. I'm working towards learning Python first and then moving on to HTML and JAVA.
